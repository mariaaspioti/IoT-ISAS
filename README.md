# IoT-ISAS
---
IoT-ISAS is a smart security and access management system designed to monitor personnel movement, manage authorized access, and handle emergency notifications. Using technologies like NFC Tags & Readers, Bluetooth & GPS trackers, smart locks, SOS buttons, and cameras, the system provides centralized control through a dashboard. It also supports scheduling and tracking facility maintenances, as well as viewing historical movement data for personnel.

### Personnel Tracking & Access Control

### SOS Button - Alert in Dashboard

The SOS Button provided to all workers for emergencies, creates an alert that appears both as a mark on the map and in the Active Alerts list on the dashboard. Each alert diplays essential information, including who pressed the button, their coordinates and whether they are inside a building or outdoors. Security officers can handle the alert by unlocking all doors, activating the alarm, or dismissing the alert. The demo video shows a real SOS button press, the real time visual output in the dashboard and the alert being dismissed.

### Worker Movement History View

Selecting _"Show historic routes"_ allows you to visualize the __movement paths__ of each worker for a chosen date and time span. Within that time span, a slider lets you further narrow the visible timeline to a custom range. This video showcases the trails of two simulated workers during 30-minute period
