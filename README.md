IoT-ISAS is a smart security and access management system designed to monitor personnel movement, manage authorized access, and handle emergency notifications. Using technologies like NFC Tags & Readers, Bluetooth & GPS trackers, smart locks, SOS buttons, and cameras, the system provides centralized control through a dashboard. It also supports scheduling and tracking facility maintenances, as well as viewing historical movement data for personnel.
